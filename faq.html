                <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>“What exactly is “Trauma” and why
                    is everyone talking about it?”</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Essentially, trauma any experience that has left you feeling
                        frightened, shaken, and powerless that you either can’t stop thinking about or go out of your
                        way to actively avoid. Basically it’s any even from your past that you just can’t get past.
                        Trauma can cause chronic nightmares, sleepless nights, panic attacks, being easily startled, or
                        feeling numb to yourself and/or others. Trauma can be but isn’t limited to natural disasters,
                        combat or active war zones, sexual assaults and child maltreatment. Psychotherapists often refer
                        to these as “Big T Traumas”. But there are “Little T Traumas” as well. These often look like
                        exposure to violence, witnessing the death of a loved one, school bullying, or workplace
                        mistreatment. If any of these sound like experiences in your life coming in to speak with a
                        therapist may be helpful. </span></div>

                    therapy?”</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Well, the short answer is we all could use someone who will
                        genuinely listen to us every now and then. The long answer, you may be doing fine or maybe
                        telling yourself you’re doing fine is helping you fake it until you make it. It may also be that
                        you feel you’re doing fine but your friends or family often says that they’re “worried about
                        you”. Whatever the situation, therapy can help you sort things out and learn new ways to not
                        only react to situations but new ways to see yourself in general.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>No! Seeing a therapist does not mean you are crazy. It means
                        different things for everyone. For some it means you need a little help. For others it means you
                        want to see yourself in a new light. For still others going to therapy means learning new skills
                        to cope with the stress that life deals us all.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Everyone has their stuff and for all of us its painful to one degree
                        or another. In order for your therapist to know and honor you, your therapist needs to know and
                        honor this. Therapy moves at your pace and at your comfort level. Your therapist will do
                        everything they can to not push you to discuss anything until you are ready.</span></div>

                    forever?”</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Absolutely not. The job of a good therapist is to work themselves
                        out of a job. Your therapist will want to establish a strong rapport in order for your work
                        together to be effective but they won’t want you to ever feel as though you can’t function
                        without them or the process. Through the treatment planning process your therapist will help you
                        come up with a treatment and timeline that works for you.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Therapy isn’t a “one size fits all” process and no one therapist is
                        right for everyone. If you feel your therapist isn’t a good fit for you or that you’re just not
                        comfortable with the dynamic your therapist will gladly help you to find the right clinician for
                        you! If more care is needed, we will help you move in that direction also!</span></div>

                        fit the client. We also recognize that sometimes a more specific approach is needed.

                                        develop new skills to challenge unhelpful thoughts, reduce unhelpful behaviors,
                                        and reduce your experiences of difficult emotions. CBT is a highly researched
                                        treatment method and has proved effective in treating everything from depression
                                        and anxiety to obsessive compulsive disorder.
